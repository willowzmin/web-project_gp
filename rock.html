                       and heavy metal have all been used to characterize <br>
                       their music, but the band simply calls it "rock and roll.<br>

                       High Voltage, AC/DC suffered a number of line-up changes. <br>
                       Later, the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott,<br>
                        Phil Rudd, and Mark Evans became the core of<br>
                         the band's lineup. Evans was kicked out of <br>
                         the group in 1977, and Cliff Williams took his <br>
                         place. Ever since 1978's Powerage, Williams has <br>
                         appeared on every AC/DC album.

                     Freddie Mercury sang lead and played the piano for the group, which<br>

                       as they increasingly included other genres, like arena rock and <br>
                       pop rock, they began to produce more mainstream, radio-friendly music.<br>
